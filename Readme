This repository is simply for me to learn how to build scripts to simplify the process of using Kali tools, it is for educational purposes only and some of the scripts may not work/be incorrect as I am learning myself. 

None of the tools used linked/used in the script have been developed by me and many can be found in the kali linux operating system.
